    <h1>About Our Shelter</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        We provide education, advocacy, and shelter for animals in need.

        RoboGarden Pet Shelter was established as a non-profit organization in 1899 and exists to improve the
        lives of animals in our community by providing temporary shelter and appropriate new families for surrendered
        animals.

        Throughout the years, we have worked tirelessly to assist animals by providing them with a home until they can
        be adopted into a new family. We rely solely on individual and corporate donations in order to provide care for
        animals in our community.

        Our mission is toÂ lead London and Middlesex in building a humane and compassionate community for all animals.

        Charitable registration no. 119023869RR 0001
